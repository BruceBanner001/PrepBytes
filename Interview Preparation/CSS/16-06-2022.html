        <b>Q1.Difference between Flex Row and Column ?</b>

                The flex-direction property specifies the direction of the flexible items. <br>
                <strong>Flex Row:</strong><br>
                The Child Containers will be placed Horizontally accroding to the Parent Container. <br>
                <strong>Flex Column:</strong><br>
                The Child Containers will be placed Vertically accroding to the Parent Container. <br>
                <strong>Note:</strong> First we need to define display as Flex in Parent Container. Otherwise, it won't work.

                &lt;div class="container"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="child"&gt;One&lt;/div&gt;

                It also add <strong>Unique Style</strong> to same type of HTML 
                Elements or Class or ID in Single HTML File. We define Internal CSS inside an <strong><head></strong> 
                Tag. <br> <br>
                <strong>External:</strong>
                It is also same as Internal CSS but with one difference.
                External means we save styles in different file end with .css.
                We can use this External Styles as much as want in any number of 
                HTML files. In order to use that we have to <strong>link</strong>
                the CSS File using <strong>link tag.</strong>

                current position without changing the layout around it. <br>
                <strong>Position: absolute:</strong><br>
