    <h2>Difference between '==' and '===' ?</h2>
        <p>
            Double Equals('==') check only 'values'. Triple Equals ('===') checks both 'values' and 'Data types'.
        </p>
    <h2>What is the Spread Operator ?</h2>
        <p>
            It is new operator that introduced in ES6.
            it used to expand or combine array or string.
            What is spread operator in JS?
            The JavaScript spread operator ( ... ) allows us to quickly copy all or part of an existing array or object into another array or object.
            Syntax - ...array
        </p>
    <h2>What are the difference between var, let and const ?</h2>
        <p>
            let : <br>
                1. we can Declare the Variable Name in one line and initialize on another line.
                2. The variables with same name aren't possible with let.
                3. We can reassign/update the value of the variable.
                4. let is block scoped.
                5. let doesn't supports hoisting. ("Hoisting allows functions to be safely used in code before they are declared")
        </p>
        <p>
            var : <br>
            1. we can Declare the Variable Name in one line and initialize on another line.
            2. The variables with same name are possible with var.
            3. We can reassign/update the value of the variable.
            4. let is global scoped.
            5. var supports hoisting.
        </p>
        <p>
            const: <br>
                const : (introduced in ES6)
                1. Must declare and initialize variable in the same line itself.
                2. The variables with same name aren't possible with const.
                3. We can't reassign/update the value of the variable.
                4. const is block scoped.
                5. const doesn't supports hoisting.
        </p>
    <h2>TDZ ?</h2>
        <p>
            <li>The term to describe the state where variables are un-reachable. They are in scope, but they aren't declared. The let and const variables exist in the TDZ from the start of their enclosing scope until they are declared.</li>
        </p>
    <h2>Global Execution ?</h2>
        <p>
            Global Execution Context (GEC). <br>
            <li>
                Whenever the JavaScript engine receives a script file, it first creates a default Execution Context known as the Global Execution Context (GEC) . The GEC is the base/default Execution Context where all JavaScript code that is not inside of a function gets executed. For every JavaScript file, there can only be one GEC.
            </li>
        </p>
        <p>
            Function Execution Context (FEC). <br>
            <li>
                Whenever a function is called, the JavaScript engine creates a different type of Execution Context known as a Function Execution Context (FEC) within the GEC to evaluate and execute the code within that function.
            </li>
            <li>
                Since every function call gets its own FEC, there can be more than one FEC in the run-time of a script.
            </li>
        </p>
    <h2>Closures ?</h2>
        <li>
            It is a Combination of inner function and lexical(variable) environment of outer function.
        </li>
        <li>
            Its not something that we create manually or explicitly.
        </li>
        <li>
            A closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.
        </li>
        <li>
            A closure is a function having access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Closures makes a function remember all the variables that existed in the function birth place initially.
        </li>
    <h2>Event Loop ?</h2>
        <li>The event loop is a constantly running process that monitors both the callback queue and the call stack. If the call stack is not empty, the event loop waits until it is empty and places the next function from the callback queue to the call stack.</li>
